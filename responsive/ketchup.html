<h2> History of Ketchup </h2>
    <p>Ketchup has a rich and varied history that dates back to the 17th century, originating from a fermented fish sauce called "kecap" used by Southeast Asian cultures. European sailors encountered this condiment while trading in the region, which eventually inspired modifications back home. By the 18th century, recipes for tomato ketchup began to emerge in the United States, diverging from its original recipe that primarily featured mushrooms and spices. The 19th century saw the commercialization of ketchup, with Heinz leading the way by bottling the product in 1876, making it widely available to the public. As it gained popularity, ketchup evolved into a staple condiment, especially paired with fast food and home-cooked meals. Today, ketchup is celebrated globally, embraced in numerous culinary traditions while remaining a quintessential accompaniment to fries and burgers alike.</p>
